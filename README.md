# quiz_game
Hello people I am working on this game to better understand how github works 
this is simple project game 

you will run this code and 
this game will ask fre questions from you 
if you answer it correctly, you will get a score of  1 
every wrong answer gets 0, 
at the end you will get your final score 


now this is a simple game but I will keep adding the features which will make it more useful and fun to play 
it will also help practice general and even specific domain knowledge when done
